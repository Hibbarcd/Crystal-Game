# Crystal-Game.
This game was created as part of an assignment for the U of MN coding bootcamp. It illustrates how javascript can be used to create randomly assigned values to on click events to form a basic game. 

To Play:
Click the crystals to match the randomly generated number. Be careful since each crystal has a random value, and it changes every game. Wins and losses will be tallied as multiple games are played.
